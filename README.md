The link above is more or less what I use in order to brainstorm ideas for this project. 

Some of the ideas I have in mind for the website and structure have or will change over time. 

1. What does the project do?

 Playing Warframe can be a chore when you have no idea what to do. So hopefully this website solves some of the problems new players deal with. This project will try to streamline some of the large amount of information given to the player. But also try to give the player something to stand on and enjoy the game as much as any veteran can potentially. 

2. Who is the project for? 

 This website will try to stay focused on the newcomers to Warframe. It can be a bit hard to try and focus on the veterans since they know enough to not need a website dedicated to tips for starting out and what they should know. 

3. Why is this website different?

 Let's just say that you can find any and all information to help you do anything in warframe. But this website compared to for example, the company's website for Warframe is a bit intimidating to navigate. And new players just wanna know what they need in order to benefit their own time.
